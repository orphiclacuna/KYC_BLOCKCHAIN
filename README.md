# KYC Blockchain System

## Overview
The KYC Blockchain System is a decentralized solution for securely managing Know Your Customer (KYC) documents using blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, users can perform KYC verification once and securely share their data with institutions, maintaining control over who can access it.

## Features
- **Single KYC Process**: Users complete KYC verification once and can share the details with multiple organizations.
- **Blockchain Security**: Immutable, tamper-proof KYC records.
- **Decentralized Storage**: KYC documents are stored using decentralized storage solutions (IPFS).
- **User Access Control**: Users grant or revoke access to their documents via smart contracts.

## Technologies Used
- **Truffle**: Ethereum development framework.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain emulator.
- **React.js**: Frontend user interface.
- **Web3.js**: Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with the blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for transactions.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage for documents.

## Smart Contracts

### KYCVerification.sol
The `KYCVerification.sol` contract manages:
- **User Registration**: Users register their KYC details on the blockchain.
- **Document Verification**: Authorized verifiers can verify users' documents.
- **Access Control**: Users can grant or revoke access to third-party organizations.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **Truffle** (v5+)
- **Ganache** (for local blockchain development)
- **MetaMask** (for blockchain wallet integration)
- **IPFS** (for decentralized storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VarunHarsha64/KYC_BLOCKCHAIN.git
   cd KYC_BLOCKCHAIN
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   rm -rf build/
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy the contracts to a local blockchain (using Ganache):
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Connect MetaMask to your local blockchain (Ganache) and interact with the dApp.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Extend support to other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain.
- **zk-SNARKs Integration**: Enhance privacy by implementing zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Government Database Integration**: Automate document verification using government records.
